# Linked Lists

This folder contains implementations of linked list data structures using pointers in C++.

## Files

- `singly_linked_list.cpp` — Singly linked list with insertion, deletion, and display.
- `doubly_linked_list.cpp` — Doubly linked list with insertion, deletion, and display (forward and backward).
- `circular_linked_list.cpp` — Circular singly linked list with insertion, deletion, and display.

## Usage

To compile and run an example:

```bash
g++ singly_linked_list.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

or

```bash
g++ doubly_linked_list.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

or

```bash
g++ circular_linked_list.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

## Notes

- All code is written in modern C++ and is well-commented for educational purposes.
- For more details on each structure, see the comments at the top of each file.
