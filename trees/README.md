# Trees

This folder contains implementations of tree data structures using pointers in C++.

## Files

- `binary_tree.cpp` — Basic binary tree with insertion and in-order traversal.
- `binary_search_tree.cpp` — Binary search tree (BST) with insertion, search, and in-order traversal.
- `avl_tree.cpp` — AVL tree (self-balancing BST) with insertion and in-order traversal.

## Usage

To compile and run an example:

```bash
g++ binary_tree.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

or

```bash
g++ binary_search_tree.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

or

```bash
g++ avl_tree.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```

## Notes

- All code is written in modern C++ and is well-commented for educational purposes.
- For more details on each structure, see the comments at the top of each file.
