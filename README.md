# Pointer Studies in C++

This repository contains didactic examples and implementations of classic data structures and pointer concepts in C++. The goal is to provide a clear reference for learning and practicing pointer manipulation and dynamic memory management.

## 📂 Structure

- `linked_lists/`  
  Implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.

- `trees/`  
  Implementations of binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.

- `stacks_queues/`  
  Implementations of dynamic stacks and queues using pointers.

- `pointers_basics/`  
  Basic pointer concepts, pointer arithmetic, pointers to functions, and dynamic memory allocation.

- `utils/`  
  Utility files, such as memory leak examples.

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

To compile any file, use:

```bash
g++ path/to/file.cpp -o exec && ./exec
```
